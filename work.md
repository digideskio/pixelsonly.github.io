## Work Experience

**RED Digital Cinema** / '11&ndash;Current / Sr. Web Application Developer / <a href="http://www.red.com" title="www.red.com" target="_blank">red.com</a>

Senior developer with a focus on user-interfaces for customer-facing and internal applications. I work closely with our marketing and creative teams to deliver products that reach our global customer base.

Technology: Ruby/Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

##### Workflow &amp; Documentation
Created comprehensive wiki documentation for developers—covering everything from our on boarding to development workflow, deployment processes, and miscellaneous DevOps tasks.


##### RED UI Toolkit
The RED UI Toolkit is comprised of global styles & common user-interface components for building modern web applications and hybrid native apps. This project includes living documentation, a visual style guide and CDN delivered assets. It gives our developers the tools they need to be more effective by focusing on app specific code and reducing boilerplate.

I leveraged the power and flexibility of Bower for dependency management and crafted a ruby-based build process to compile top-level manifests. The build process ensures maximum compatibility across pre-processed languages such as SASS, LESS or Coffeescript. All static assets are deployed via the Amazon AWS CLI and available immediately.

##### Front-end Architecture
Migrated front-end asset delivery from the host application to Amazon AWS infrastructure which resulted in reduced HTTP responses and latency. Client-side rendering was also reduced by more than 1 second on average.

Improved i18n configuration and workflow between development and content teams. These changes reduced the burden on developers via the increased separation of concerns while simultaneously providing efficiencies for the content managers and their translation process.

Re-engineered one of our common third party API integrations as a background job to improve user experience and increase code reuse.

Assisted our desktop software development team by configuring the required Amazon AWS infrastructure which increased the automation of their release management. These improvements also reduced the strain on our content management team by removing the manual compression and uploading tasks while providing an improved experience for our end-users.

##### RED RAVEN Microsite
Working in collaboration with the creative and marketing teams, I was challenged to deliver a high impact microsite for RED’s latest cinema camera. My role involved crafting the overall user-experience  The RED UI Toolkit proved vital in our ability to exceed expectations and still hit our deadline. The RED RAVEN microsite has risen to be our second most visited page and has set a new record for a 10x traffic spike on launch day.

##### RED Armory - Camera Package Builder
The RED Armory addressed a vital customer need which allowed them to easily compare products and accessories across multiple categories for the very first time. This visual sales tool provides an efficient way for RED customers to build their ideal camera package and has proven itself to be a valuable lead generation tool for our sales teams.

My role included designing a new user-interface based upon business requirements and UX recommendations. I implemented numerous features which included custom package saving/sharing and international currency support. I leveraged modern browser technology and capabilities for data persistence and an overall enhanced user-experience.

##### Content Management System Redesign
Based upon feedback from various end-users I redesigned the custom content management system to address numerous efficiency and workflow issues. I introduced a more modern ui aesthetic and improved overall usability across the entire interface.

Some key areas of improvement included enhanced search interfaces, new dashboard with data visualizations and robust content publishing tools.

##### REDTools iOS App
A convenient multipurpose tool designed for on-set use by digital imaging technicians and camera operators. It features six different tools that can assist with various camera settings and shooting situations. 

I developed this app as a side project with the intent of expanding my skills and capabilities. I was particularly interested in exploring hybrid native apps and was pleased to be able to bring this to market. Some of the challenges that I overcame included integration of the native Google Analytics library as well as native UIWebView configuration for hybrid apps.
