**Personal Music API** &nbsp;<a href="http://music.ryanlindsey.me" target="_blank">visit</a>

It has been a goal of mine to revisit the concept &amp; architecture of my Pixus project from years back. I wanted a more scalable &amp; performant way to not only retrieve the basic metadata about the music I'm listening to, but also aggregate trends &amp; build connections.

By leveraging the flexibility &amp; power of cloud-based hosting I was able to rapidly develop &amp; deploy a high-performance API that will eventually serve as the data-layer for future applications.

* JSON API &amp; <a href="http://panic.com/statusboard/" target="_blank">Panic StatusBoard</a> support
* Rails 3.2+, MongoDB &amp; Redis

**PremiereTime** &nbsp;<a href="http://www.premieretime.com/" target="_blank">visit</a>

A personal exercise looking at responsive layouts &amp; high-performance static websites.

* Hosted entirely on AWS Cloudfront CDN
* Dynamic data auto-updated during build process
* Client-side search for optimal user-experience

**Ridiculous Name Archive** &nbsp;<a href="http://ridiculousarchive.com" target="_blank">visit</a>

You can pretty much blame <a href="https://twitter.com/pixelpanther" target="_blank">@pixelpanther</a> for this. What started as an inside joke between some co-working friends via pre-dawn text messages eventually became a full-blown web application with social network authentication &amp; integration.

* High-perfomance cloud-hosted Rails 3.2+, Postgresql &amp; memcached
* AJAX voting & commenting
* Oauth integration via Facebook &amp; Twitter

**Pixus App** &nbsp;<a href="http://www.pixusapp.com" target="_blank">visit</a>

An experimental project that combined music discovery with generative art. The desktop application allowed users to create unique desktop wallpaper derived from the metadata associated with songs from Pandora's streaming service.

The marketing, download &amp; support site included a seamless installer for the **Pixus** Adobe Air desktop application. The API was designed to communicate with desktop clients using Zend AMF.

* Front-end built with the Codeigniter PHP framework
* API utilized Zend framework with AMF support
* Desktop application developed with Adobe Air
