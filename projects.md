You can pretty much blame <a href="https://twitter.com/pixelpanther" target="_blank">@pixelpanther</a> for this. What started as an inside joke between some co-working friends via pre-dawn text messages eventually became a full-blown web application with social network authentication &amp; integration.

* High-perfomance cloud-hosted Rails 3.2+, Postgresql &amp; memcached
* Mobile-first UI
* Oauth integration via Facebook &amp; Twitter

A single-page app built with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/){:target="_blank"} that showcases a few basic features of my [Music API](http://music.ryanlindsey.me){:target="_blank"}. I have been interested in AngularJS for awhile and I was quite impressed with how easy it was to hook up a 3rd party API and render a user-interface. I was impressed with the lack of boilerplate required to achieve the desired result.

* Consumes a JSON API from another personal project
* Built with Middleman and written in Coffeescript &amp; HAML
* Served via Github Pages

It has been a goal of mine to revisit the concept &amp; architecture of my Pixus project from years back. I wanted a more scalable &amp; performant way to not only retrieve the basic metadata about the music I'm listening to, but also aggregate trends &amp; build connections.

By leveraging the flexibility &amp; power of cloud-based hosting I was able to rapidly develop &amp; deploy a high-performance API that will eventually serve as the data-layer for future applications.

* JSON API &amp; <a href="http://panic.com/statusboard/" target="_blank">Panic StatusBoard</a> support
* Rails 3.2+, MongoDB &amp; Redis

An experimental project that combined music discovery with generative art. The desktop application allowed users to create unique desktop wallpaper derived from the metadata associated with songs from Pandora's streaming service.

The marketing, download &amp; support site included a seamless installer for the **Pixus** Adobe Air desktop application. The API was designed to communicate with desktop clients using Zend AMF.

* Built on the Codeigniter PHP framework
* Served via Amazon S3
* API utilized Zend framework with AMF support
